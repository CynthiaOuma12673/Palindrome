## Palindrome Checker
This is a simple Node.js program that allows you to check if a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.


## Usage
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the directory containing the source code file (palindrome.js).

- Run the program using the following command:

- node palindrome.js in the terminal

- The program will prompt you to enter a word.

- Enter the word and press Enter.

- The program will check if the word is a palindrome and provide the result.

## How It Works
The Palindrome Checker program is implemented in Node.js and works as follows:

- It uses the readline module to interact with the user through the command line.
- The user is prompted to enter a word.
- The program checks if the entered word is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
- If the word is a palindrome, it displays the message "It's a palindrome!"
- If the word is not a palindrome, it displays the reversed word with the message "This is not a palindrome. Reversed: {reversed}".
- Development Environment
- Programming Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Node.js Version: 14.17.0 (or compatible)
- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux
